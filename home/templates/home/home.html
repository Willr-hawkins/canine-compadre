                        Hi, I’m Alex Bevis, and I’m lucky to call the beautiful village of Croyde in North Devon my home.
                        After being made redundant, I saw it as the perfect opportunity to follow a passion that’s always
                        been close to my heart — dogs.
                        I’ve always had a deep love and respect for animals, especially my own dog Chester,
                        a gentle and loyal Ridgeback who’s been my best companion through thick and thin.

                        Starting a dog walking business felt like a natural next step.
                        I’ve grown up surrounded by dogs and understand just how important they are to our lives — they’re
                        not just pets, they’re family.
                        I’m friendly, reliable, and deeply rooted in the local community, with many friends and connections
                        who know me as someone you can count on.

                    My goal is to offer a service that’s not only trustworthy but full of genuine love for every dog I meet.
